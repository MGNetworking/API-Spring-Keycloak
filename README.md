# API Spring Keycloak

User Management API with Profile Extension and Keycloak Integration
This project is a secure RESTful API built with Spring Boot, designed to handle user account registration, role
administration through Keycloak, and the extension of custom business data per user.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Features

1. User Management (UsersController)
    * Registers users in Keycloak, which handles identity and authentication.
    * Upon registration, custom business-related data is created and stored in the API's own database, associated with
      the user‚Äôs unique ID from the Keycloak token.
    * No personal identity data (name, email, password) is stored in the API; these are managed entirely within
      Keycloak.
    * The user‚Äôs Keycloak ID (sub from the JWT token) is used to link and manipulate business-related data.

2. Administration Tools (AdminController)
    * Allows administrators to retrieve and manage user roles at the realm or client level within Keycloak.
    * Provides endpoints to assign/remove roles, enable/disable user accounts, and trigger password resets.
    * Authorization is enforced using roles extracted from the JWT token issued by Keycloak.

üîí Security Model
Authentication is managed by Keycloak, and all endpoints are protected by role-based access control
(ROLE_USER_REALM, ROLE_ADMIN_REALM).
The JWT token is used both for authorization and to resolve the identity of the business data owner.

## Security Configuration

Security is managed through the `SecurityConfig` class, with the following features:

- **CSRF Disabled**: Since the API is stateless.
- **JWT Configuration**: Roles are extracted from Keycloak tokens.
- **Authorization Rules**:
    - Public access is allowed for authentication and documentation endpoints.
    - Access to `/api/v1/admin/**` is restricted to users with the `ROLE_ADMIN` authority.
    - Authentication is required for all other endpoints.

## Endpoints Main

### User management

* class : UsersController

| Endpoint               | M√©thode | Description   | R√¥le Requis | Codes R√©ponse                     |
|------------------------|---------|---------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| /api/v1/users/register | POST    | User creation | ROLE_BASIC  | 201, 400, 401, 403, 409, 500      |
| /api/v1/users/user     | PUT     | User update   | ROLE_BASIC  | 200, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500      |
| /api/v1/users/{id}     | DELETE  | User deletion | ROLE_BASIC  | 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500 |
| /api/v1/users/{id}     | GET     | User recovery | ROLE_BASIC  | 200, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500      |

üìù Description:
This controller manages the business data associated with a user.
It can only be accessed after authentication via Keycloak, guaranteeing secure operations. It can be used to add,
modify, delete and view data linked to the logged-in user. Each action is protected by appropriate role-based access
control (`ROLE_BASIC`).

### Administration

* class: AdminController

| Endpoint                                                | M√©thode | Description                                                 | R√¥le Requis      | Codes R√©ponse                |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| /api/v1/admin/users                                     | GET     | Lists all users registered in the Keycloak realm.           | ROLE_ADMIN_FRONT | 200, 401, 403,  500          |
| /api/v1/admin/roles/realm                               | GET     | List of client roles on configured domains                  | ROLE_ADMIN_FRONT | 200, 401, 403,  500          |
| /api/v1/admin/roles/client/{targetClient}               | GET     | list of any client roles configured on the targeted domains | ROLE_ADMIN_FRONT | 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 |
| /api/v1/admin/user/{userId}/{targetClient}              | GET     | list of user roles on the targeted client                   | ROLE_ADMIN_FRONT | 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 |
| /api/v1/admin/user/{userId}/roles/client/{targetClient} | POST    | Add roles to user on the targeted client                    | ROLE_ADMIN_FRONT | 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 |
| /api/v1/admin/user/{userId}/roles/client/{targetClient} | DELETE  | Removal of the user's role on the targeted client           | ROLE_ADMIN_FRONT | 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 |
| /api/v1/admin/users/{userId}/roles/realm                | POST    | Add role to user on targeted domain                         | ROLE_ADMIN_FRONT | 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 |
| /api/v1/admin/users/{userId}/roles/realm                | DELETE  | removal of the user's role on the targeted domain           | ROLE_ADMIN_FRONT | 204, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 |

üìù Description:

This controller provides administrative tools for managing user roles in Keycloak. Each action is protected by
appropriate role-based access control (`ROLE_ADMIN_FRONT`).

## Codes de R√©ponse HTTP

The API uses the following standard HTTP status codes:

| Code | Description                                                                      |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200  | **OK** - The request was successful                                              |
| 201  | **Created** - Successfully created resource                                      |
| 204  | **No Content** - Request processed successfully but no content to return         |
| 400  | **Bad Request** - The request contains errors or invalid data                    |
| 401  | **Unauthorized** - Authentication required or authentication failed              |
| 404  | **Not Found** - The requested resource does not exist                            |
| 409  | **Conflict** - The request cannot be processed due to a conflict (ex: duplicate) |
| 500  | **Internal Server Error** - Unexpected server-side error                         |

## Maven Wrapper: How It Works

### What is Maven Wrapper?

Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`) is a script that allows you to run Maven commands without having Maven installed on your system.

## How it works

When you execute the `./mvnw` command (or `mvnw.cmd` on Windows):

1. The Maven Wrapper script checks if Maven is already available in a local directory of the project (typically
   `.mvn/wrapper/`)

2. If Maven is not found locally, the script automatically downloads the appropriate version of Maven specified in your
   project

3. Then, the script executes the Maven command you requested using this downloaded version

## What about JDK?

* The Maven Wrapper downloads Maven, but not the JDK
* A JDK is still necessary to compile and run Java code
* If you don't have a JDK installed, you'll get an error like "JAVA_HOME is not set" or "java command not found"

## Benefits

* Ensures everyone on the team uses the same Maven version
* No need to install Maven globally on your machine
* Makes project setup easier for new developers
* Perfect for CI/CD pipelines where you want to control the Maven version

## Common Usage

```bash
# Linux/Mac
./mvnw clean install

# Windows
mvnw.cmd clean install
```

In a Spring development environment, you'll still need to install a JDK, but not necessarily Maven thanks to the
wrapper.
